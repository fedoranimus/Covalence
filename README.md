 ## Getting Started

 ## Design Documentation

 1. Users create a basic bio about themselves, add tags for their interests, and include a bio. Users can also include what they're looking for (need help with something, willing to help others, etc), there is also a flag stating whether or not they're willing to mentor.
 1. The system uses location information to help guide the search algorithm for people with similar interests who are nearby.
 1. Users can then connect with like-minded people and communicate via email.
